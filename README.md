### Hi there 👋

🙋‍♂ I am Emirhan KEŞKEK, a university student from Turkey. I am currently studying mechatronics engineering.

🌱 I am currently learning the basics of CS.

💬 You can ask me anything about anything on my repositories.

🧗‍♂️ Outside the world of tech too, I enjoy pushing myself to develop new skills. I am currently trying to learn German and reach a goal of reading.
